        <h3>Future</h3>
        <p>The future of AI can go one of two ways, either good or bad.​

            Many of the concerns with an AI is that it become a super intelligent AI that will someday control the world. What in actuality is the main concern for many is that AI goals will be the same goals that us human want as well.​
            
            The only way to control the future of AI is to make sure there are enough people who are smart enough and now how to correctly control the algorithms so that if it does get off track it can be corrected properly.​
            
            AI is an amazing tool if used correctly and if not, very dangerous.​
